    Progressively Enhanced Form Validation, Part 3: Validating a checkbox group
  </h1>
  <p>
    This form uses browser built-in form validation when JavaScript is not
    available.
  </p>
  <p>
    When JavaScript is available, the form is progressively enhanced using the
    Constraint Validation API. Custom JavaScript logic was added to handle the
    "interests" checkbox group.
