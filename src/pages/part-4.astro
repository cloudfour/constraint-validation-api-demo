    Progressively Enhanced Form Validation, Part 4: Custom validation messages
  </h1>
  <p>
    This form uses browser built-in form validation when JavaScript is not
    available.
  </p>
  <p>
    When JavaScript is available, the form is progressively enhanced using the
    Constraint Validation API.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The ValidityState API was used to create custom validation messages</li>
    <li>
      Custom JavaScript logic was added to handle the "interests" checkbox group
    </li>
  </ul>
