## Part 4 notes

- For `rangeUnderflow` or `rangeOverflow`, I can't mention even/odd number detail because the message needs to be more generic.
- String.prototype.includes is not supported in IE11: https://caniuse.com/es6-string-includes

## TODO Once all parts are published

### Part 2

Add links:

- Part 4 of this series will explore this very topic.
- Part 4 will explore using the Constraint Validation APIâ€™s ValidityState interface to help render custom validation error messages.

## Notes

Add somewhere:

> Using the aria-describedby property to provide a descriptive label for user interface controls

## Use "Wrapping Up" section to close out

Better (IMO) than "Conclusion" or "Summary".
